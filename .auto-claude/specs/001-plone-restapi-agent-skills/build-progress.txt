Project: Plone REST API Agent Skills Enhancement
Workspace: /home/maik/develop/claude/plone-restapi-skills
Started: 2026-01-14

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: Extending existing documentation-based skills to comprehensively cover ALL Plone REST API documentation chapters. Pure documentation work with no infrastructure changes.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Completed Phase 0: Deep codebase investigation
- Created/updated project_index.json with skill structure
- Created/updated context.json with task context
- Created implementation_plan.json with 4 phases, 14 subtasks
- Created init.sh for environment verification
- Created build-progress.txt

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Documentation Research): 3 subtasks, depends on []
  - Use btca to fetch ALL Plone REST API Usage and Endpoints chapters
  - Create gap analysis comparing current skills to official docs

- Phase 2 (Backend Skill Enhancement): 3 subtasks, depends on [phase-1]
  - Fetch detailed backend patterns from official docs
  - Update SKILL.md with missing service patterns
  - Update reference.md with additional examples

- Phase 3 (Client Skill Enhancement): 5 subtasks, depends on [phase-1]
  - Fetch detailed endpoint documentation
  - Update SKILL.md endpoint tables with missing endpoints
  - Add JavaScript/TypeScript examples for new endpoints
  - Add Python examples for new endpoints
  - Update reference.md with additional patterns

- Phase 4 (Verification): 4 subtasks, depends on [phase-2, phase-3]
  - Verify no btca references in skill files
  - Verify YAML frontmatter validity
  - Verify endpoint coverage completeness
  - Review code examples for syntax correctness

Services Involved:
- plone-restapi-backend: Backend development patterns (Python/Plone services)
- plone-restapi-client: Client development patterns (JS/TS/Python)

Files to Modify:
- .claude/skills/plone-restapi-backend/SKILL.md
- .claude/skills/plone-restapi-backend/reference.md
- .claude/skills/plone-restapi-client/SKILL.md
- .claude/skills/plone-restapi-client/reference.md

Current Skill Status (Pre-Enhancement):
- Backend SKILL.md: ~525 lines (comprehensive service patterns)
- Backend reference.md: ~440 lines (7 advanced examples)
- Client SKILL.md: ~1150 lines (endpoint tables + client implementations)
- Client reference.md: ~693 lines (TypeScript, Vue, Svelte, CLI)

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 2
- Recommended workers: 1 (conservative for documentation work)
- Parallel groups: [phase-2-backend-enhancement, phase-3-client-enhancement]
  (Both depend only on phase-1, modify different files)

Critical Constraints:
- btca tool used ONLY during implementation for documentation research
- btca must NOT appear in final skill content
- Both JavaScript/TypeScript AND Python examples required
- Skills must be self-contained documentation

Verification Strategy:
- Risk Level: low
- No automated tests (documentation project)
- Focus on completeness and structural integrity
- Key checks: btca independence, YAML validity, endpoint coverage

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, the coder agent should:

1. Run init.sh to verify environment:
   cd /home/maik/develop/claude/plone-restapi-skills
   bash .auto-claude/specs/001-plone-restapi-agent-skills/init.sh

2. Begin with Phase 1 (Documentation Research):
   - Use btca to fetch Plone REST API documentation
   - Identify gaps in current skill coverage
   - Document findings before proceeding to enhancement phases

Note: This is a documentation project - no services to start.
